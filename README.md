# ASL Number Recognition: CP-468

The official repository of the ASL Number Recognition for the CP-468 final project. The following *Readme* file gives an overview about this project.

ASL (American Sign Language) is the most used sign language. A huge portion of the population has not learnt this language creating a language barrier for the mute people. This project aims to  recognize the numbers of the ASL by comparing the pixels of the image being tested to the imagesâ€™ dataset.
